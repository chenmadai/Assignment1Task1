## Question2 
# python code saved in tosscoin.py 
# simulates a fair coin toss by writing 'heads' or 'tails', depending on the outcome of a random number generator
import random # import random library
toss=random.randint(0,1) #toss variable's value randomly generated between 0 and 1.
if toss==0: # if value equals to 0 then:
    print ("Heads") #head is displayed
else: # if the toss is not 0 then:
    print ("Tails") # tails is displayed
